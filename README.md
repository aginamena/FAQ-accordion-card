**Frontend Mentor FAQ Accordion Card Challenge**
=====================================================

**Overview**
------------

This code is a solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge to build an FAQ accordion card. The goal is to create a card that can be viewed on different screen sizes, has hover states, and can hide/show answers to questions when clicked.

**Features**
------------

* Responsive design for various screen sizes
* Hover states for interactive elements
* Accordion functionality for hiding/showing answers to questions
* Event listeners for toggling answers on click

**Code Structure**
-----------------

The code consists of an HTML structure for the FAQ accordion card, which includes a list of frequently asked questions with corresponding answers. The HTML code is contained within a main page section and includes styles from an external stylesheet.

**Styles and Fonts**
--------------------

The code uses Google Fonts for styling and includes styles from an external stylesheet. The typography section specifies the font family, font sizes, and weights to be used for body copy and headings.

**Event Listeners**
